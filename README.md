# Unity PSD UI
This is a custom importer for Unity 3D that converts a Photoshop file to a prefab.

# How to use
Put a Photoshop file with .ui.psd (e.g. MainMenu.ui.psd) extension to Assets folder
and it will be imported. The importer will create 2 folders near the psd-file:
"layers" for extracted layers and "ui" to store the prefab.
